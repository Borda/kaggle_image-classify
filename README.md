## Experimentation

### install this tooling

A simple way how to use this basic functions:

```bash
! pip install https://github.com/Borda/kaggle_image-classify/archive/main.zip
```

## Kaggle: [Plant Pathology 2021 - FGVC8](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8)

Foliar (leaf) diseases pose a major threat to the overall productivity and quality of apple orchards.
The current process for disease diagnosis in apple orchards is based on manual scouting by humans, which is time-consuming and expensive.

The main objective of the competition is to develop machine learning-based models to accurately classify a given leaf image from the test dataset to a particular disease category, and to identify an individual disease from multiple disease symptoms on a single leaf image.

### run notebooks in Kaggle

- [Plant Pathology with Flash](https://www.kaggle.com/jirkaborovec/plant-pathology-with-pytorch-lightning-flash)
- [Plant Pathology with Lightning ⚡](https://www.kaggle.com/jirkaborovec/plant-pathology-with-lightning)
- [Plant Pathology with Lightning \[predictions\]](https://www.kaggle.com/jirkaborovec/plant-pathology-with-lightning-predictions)

### run notebooks in Colab

- [Plant pathology with Lightning](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Borda/kaggle_image-classify/blob/main/notebooks/Plant-Pathology-with-Lightning.ipynb)
- [Plant pathology with Lightning - StandAlone](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Borda/kaggle_image-classify/blob/main/notebooks/Plant-Pathology-with-Lightning_standalone.ipynb) (without this package)
- [Plant pathology with Flash](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Borda/kaggle_image-classify/blob/main/notebooks/Plant-Pathology-with-Flash.ipynb)

I would recommend uploading the dataset to you personal gDrive and then in notebooks connect the gDrive which saves you lost of time with re-uploading dataset when ever your Colab is reset... :\]

### some results

Training progress with ResNet50 with training  for 10 epochs > over 96% validation accuracy:

## Kaggle: [iMet Collection 2021 x AIC - FGVC8](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imet-2021-fgvc8)

The online cataloguing information is generated by subject matter experts and includes a wide range of data. These include, but are not limited to: multiple object classifications, artist, title, period, date, medium, culture, size, provenance, geographic location, and other related museum objects within The Met’s collection.
Adding fine-grained attributes to aid in the visual understanding of the museum objects will enable the ability to search for visually related objects.

### run notebooks in Kaggle

- [iMet Collection with Lightning ⚡](https://www.kaggle.com/jirkaborovec/imet-with-lightning)

### run notebooks in Colab

- [iMet Collection with Lightning with ResNet50](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Borda/kaggle_image-classify/blob/main/notebooks/iMet-with-Lightning.ipynb)
- [iMet Collection with Lightning and VisionTransformers from TIMM](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Borda/kaggle_image-classify/blob/main/notebooks/iMet-with-Lightning-and-ViT.ipynb)

I would recommend uploading the dataset to you personal gDrive and then in notebooks connect the gDrive which saves you lost of time with re-uploading dataset when ever your Colab is reset... :\]

### some results

Training progress with ResNet50 with training for 35 epochs and subset labels with ore then 100 samples:
